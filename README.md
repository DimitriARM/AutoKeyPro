# AutoKeyProâ„¢
 Program for General UI Automations.

# Motivation

This project was started because I had to remove a lot of followers from my facebook account,
which was a repetitive task, and I thought "man, I wish I had
a program to do this"

Then I had to set up a questionarie from a wordDoc, had to label each
question with their respective number 120 times, and made me think again
"man, I wish I had a program to do this"

and so AutoKeyPro was born.

# Use Cases

# Todo

the program should be able to

> automate mouse and keyboard

And by that, I mean any keyboard key combination, any mouse movement

Aiming for a combination of both for complete automation

> learn, store, delete, rename automations from user input

The program will learn from the user what to do, and will repeat what the user did

# Bonus 

> add concept art

make things look cool

> add an GUI

Gui good

> add computer vision

Program will be able to read the screen and react to it
